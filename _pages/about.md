Thanks for stopping by! This site is dedicated to my hobby of Data Science and Machine Learning üß†. Feel free to take a look around at some of my favorite projects, papers I've read, and learning outcomes as I continue to dive deeper into the field.

About Me
======


![Machine Learning](images/ML_Brain.png){: .align-right width="300px"}

(As you can see) my name is Paul Frydryk. I'm born and raised in Massachusetts, and in my academic career I've always had an aptitude for Math. I attended [Western New England University](https://wne.edu/) with a Bachelor's of Science in [Actuarial Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuarial_science). During my sophomore/junior years, I began to learn Python in my courses, and instantly fell in love. With only a few semesters left, I committed to gaining a minor in computer science, focusing on Machine Learning. I found the mathematical theories behind these algorithms interesting, and became enraptured with their implementation in Python. 

After graduation, I began working as an Actuarial Student at [Symetra](https://www.symetra.com/), where I sought to bring in my ML background whenever possible. This included using optimization algorithms to create the most efficient set of insurance rates, and developing classification/probabilistic models for various insurance components.


What You'll Find Here
======

Any of my hobbyist creations that I feel worthy of sharing will be found in the [Portfolio](https://paulfryy.github.io/ProfessionalOverview/portfolio/) section. 

Sometimes I stumble across papers that catch my interest. The [Research](https://paulfryy.github.io/ProfessionalOverview/research/) section is the home for anything related to this.
